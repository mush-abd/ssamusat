# Satellite Socio-Economic Analysis and GDP Prediction Project

## Overview:
This project focuses on leveraging satellite imagery, particularly night-time lights, to analyze the socio-economic conditions of different regions and predict the GDP per capita. By employing image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms in Python, we aim to extract meaningful features from satellite images and correlate them with various socio-economic indicators. Additionally, we seek to build predictive models to estimate the GDP per capita of a region based on satellite-derived data.

## Objectives:
- Utilize satellite imagery data, especially night-time lights, for socio-economic analysis.
- Develop image processing algorithms to extract relevant features from satellite images.
- Correlate satellite-derived data with socio-economic indicators such as population density, economic activity, and infrastructure development.
- Build machine learning models to predict the GDP per capita of regions based on satellite-derived features.
- Visualize and interpret the results to gain insights into the socio-economic conditions and predict the economic status of different regions.

# Satellite Socio-Economic Analysis and GDP Prediction Project

## Folder Hierarchy Explanation:

- **data/**: This directory contains raw satellite imagery data obtained from satellite sources or external databases.
- **output/**: Here, processed data, analysis results, and model predictions are stored. This includes any intermediate data generated during the processing pipeline as well as final analysis outputs.
- **scripts/**: This directory contains Python scripts that implement various stages of the project pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, data analysis, machine learning modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Place raw satellite imagery data in the **data/** directory.
3. Run the scripts in the **scripts/** directory sequentially to preprocess the data, extract features, perform analysis, build predictive models, evaluate the models, and visualize the results.
4. Explore the **output/** directory for processed data, analysis outputs, and model predictions.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, fiona, rasterio, matplotlib, statsmodels, scikit-learn, tqdm, etc. (See requirements.txt for a full list of dependencies)
