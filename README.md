# Satellite Socio-Economic Analysis Project

## Overview:
This project aims to analyze satellite imagery, particularly night-time lights, to derive insights into the socio-economic conditions of different regions. By leveraging image processing techniques and data analysis in Python, we aim to extract meaningful information from satellite images and correlate it with various socio-economic indicators.

## Objectives:
- Utilize satellite imagery data, particularly night-time lights, for socio-economic analysis.
- Develop image processing algorithms to extract relevant features from satellite images.
- Correlate satellite-derived data with socio-economic indicators such as population density, economic activity, and infrastructure development.
- Visualize and interpret the results to gain insights into the socio-economic conditions of different regions.
